## Getting the sub domain spike

Currently done in the most ghetto way imaginable.

* In /etc/hosts add these two lines

    127.0.0.1 test.localhost.com

* In rails console run

ToDo: get seed data working

    Customer.new(name:'test', color:'FFE9E9').save

Then you can goto either http://test.localhost.com:3000

* Looking at developer new relic stats

    http://localhost:3000/newrelic
